Select the **modified** asset file and click "Open";

Okay, if you finished everything above, make sure the game is not open, if it is, close it and click on "Load" button.

# I want the original asset back, what should I do?

It's simple! just click on "Replace Modified Game Asset"!

## I closed the program... what do I do now?

There is still no problem! go to your "Documents" folder and search for "Unity AssetLoader" and enter the folder;

Inside the folder, there will be another folder called "assets", enter it;

Ok, now inside the "assets" folder you will have other folders, filter by "Modified date", open the first folder, inside you will have the backup of the original asset;

Once you find the original game asset, right-click the file, and click "Cut", then just go to the game's data folder (or something similar), right-click the bottom of the folder, and click on "Paste" (if you ask to replace, accept).

(in this case it should be written "Cut", my computer is in Portuguese, that's why it says "Recortar")

Done! now you can play the game smoothly!
